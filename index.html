    <h1>War Card Game</h1>
    <p>War is a card game played by two players using a standard playing card deck. To win the game, a player must earn more points than the other player.</p>
    <p>In this simplified version of War, each player gets a full deck of 52 cards. In unison, each player draws a card from their deck—this is a "battle"—and the player with the higher card earns 1 point. If there is a tie, neither player earns a point. Aces are high, and suits are ignored.</p>
